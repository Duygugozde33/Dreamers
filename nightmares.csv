"This dream was a sequel to a earlier dream in which a man named Makmool Jadorcade (""Crazy Makmool"") killed a number of people (including me, I think) in a quarry. In this second dream, I was at work and was charged with keeping something safe, although I didn't know exactly what it was (it was in a briefcase) nor why it was important. I put the briefcase in a safe and stood in front guarding it. Then I saw Crazy Makmool talking to my boss, which naturally made me nervous. I tried to tell people who he was and that he was evil, but no one would listen. A while later I saw him again carrying a briefcase walking past the window in the front of the store, which gave me a horrible feeling. I turned and looked inside the safe and, sure enough, he somehow managed to take it without my noticing. I panicked and told everyone what happened, and a group of us got together, got inside a truck, and chased him down. We finally caught up to him and confronted him at the base of a quarry. That's when I looked around and realized that the people that came with me were the exact same people that Makmool had killed in the earlier dream, and I had gathered them at the exact same spot as that previous crime.

I was running away from some creature, and no matter what I did to try to stop it or try to outrun it, it just kept gaining on me. Only once did the dream actually reach a conclusion and not just ""flip to a different channel,"" and in the dream it killed me. I woke up and my heart was racing and I could not fall asleep for several hours.

"Unfortunately, I don't remember many dreams. I'm often aware that I dreamt, and remember a few things, but don't recall the whole thing and forget it after a day or two. But I do remember dreaming that I was playing baseball, and that as I ran for home, the catcher jumped on me and stabbed me. (I was maybe 10 at the time; he was a classmate of mine). I also remember being surrounded by other kids, like we were playing dodgeball, but instead they had knives and were stabbing me. I also have had dissociative states where I felt I was being kicked and beaten, but I was not asleep at the time, so they aren't really dreams. And though this is not really a nightmare, I remember a dream when I was around 18 or 20, maybe a bit older. I was taking a nap at my parents' house, in the end room of a ranch house where a door led to the outside. I dreamt that my brother, who died when I was 16 (he was almost 12) was on the other side of the screen door, banging on it and begging to be let in, while I was standing inside and wouldn't let him in. He was so close, just on the other side of the door, I could almost touch him......I woke to find my dad banging on the screen door, as it was latched and he could not get in. The dream was very unsettling, because my brother had seemed so real, he was less than a foot away, but I was teasing him, and I wanted so badly for him to come back.....",281,"Dream Text: Worst Nightmare",2010-08-03T05:13:34+00:00,zogby_052110:29440,"2010 Demographic Survey",Female,Yes,35-49,30-44,78209,"Low income","< $25K",Other,"College Degree",Col+,Other,South,"College Degree+",0,Mod,4,Other/None,,Single,"Single, never married",42.00,Yes,No,Never,"Not Important",Yes,Texas,"350,073",Other,"Other Female","39,126",Total,Yes,"NS/not religious or spiritual",0,"Very likely",Moderate,Yes,22,22,Nikes,No,Obama,6.5,Yes,No,,"Not sure","Not sure",Yes,"Not sure",No,No,Yes,Obama,Democratic,"1 to 3 times a month",Obama,"Less than once a month",Democratic,"Less than once a month",Yes,Yes,No/NS
"I can't recall any really bad ones; this is the strangest. I am removeing something from the trunk of my car, only one item I identified. It is a yellow rain coat. It is a long style like a slicker or an old duster worn in western movies. It is raining and in the process of retrieving the coat I drop it on the wet ground. It is now difficult for me to see it because it is being rapidly covered by snow. As I scrape away at the snow, I canÆt find the coat. Wile talking to my brother we become distracted by people coming by the house on the road. I canÆt see all of the people because the snow must have been plowed because there is quite a bank of snow along the length of the street. More and more people appear in the street and their attention is being drawn to the middle of the street as though there was an accident or something of similar compelling interest. I turn back to Bob but he is out of sight. I decide to go to the road to see what is going on but I find my paralyzed as is everyone else in sight. I now find myself in the living room and it is late evening specifically 10:00pm and for some reason I become aware that I went out to the car at 2:00pm. There along with Bob are a number of complete strangers. Mostly men. One man an elderly gentleman, pot-bellied, and gray hair wearing a faded green shirt seems to be in a melancholy mood and talks to me later about his loss. Not clearly defined but may be his wife. Bob implies that I have been in some kind of an unconscious state for those missing eight hours. Another man appears in the room. He speaks and while I donÆt remember the details, I found it threatening enough to get my handgun from my bedroom and put it into my pocket. Back outside I hear comings and going from a house on the other side of the street. A vehicle leaves from that house and for some reason I follow it in mine. Speeding through the city I am no longer following but seem to be heading for a specific destination. As I proceed at a high speed I deliberately crash into a truck sideswiping it.

"It was right after my first baby was born. There is a river that cuts through our town, and the San Souci bridge goes across it. It is night, winter time. I have the baby in the back seat of the car in his car seat. It is a citation. I am driving. I come up to the bridge and before I can stop I see that the bridge ends half-way across the river and I drive over the edge. All I can think is, as I'm driving over the edge in slow motion into the cold, black water is ""Oh my god I've killed the baby"". I scream in my dream and wake myself up, crying and shaking. I was so upset, in my half-wake state, that I decide to go back to sleep and have the dream again. I fell back asleep, and found myself driving my car to the bridge, just as before. But before I drive off the edge, I yank the steering wheel to the left, and avoid driving off the bridge. I pull the car to the side, and grab my baby out of his car seat and hold him tight, in his little blue, fuzzy snow suit. It is still dark, and cold, and I can see my breath. I am in the parking lot of Electric Park Ballroom--a venue that sits in the edge of the river. I am breathing fast and rocking back and forth. I saved the baby this time.

Then she turned to walk away and then made a kind of grunting noise as she doubled over as if she was in pain. The next thing I remember after that was running into one of my school teachers and talking to her on my way out of the store.

"Although this dream began as a nightmare, it had a good ending. I'm walking alone at night in an industrial area that is unfamiliar. Rather than walking on a sidewalk with paved streets and light posts, I'm walking between unlit warehouses on either side of me. Then I'm suddenly inside a large building that's similar to an enclosed parking garage--that is, it's made of cement and has a low ceiling. Rather than cars, there are stacks of boxes and crates scattered around. When I see the shadows of two or more workers moving about, I believe it's dangerous, so I hide behind some boxes. Every once in a while, I can see a worker's face--a grotesque face one sees on Halloween masks, not the face of a human. I am very scared and try to sneak away without being discovered but someone--or something--dressed in dark clothes is following me. No matter which way I go, I can't find an exit nor shake whoever is behind me. Then I run inside a theater--I have no idea how I got there! All I know is the stage and seats are to my right, a wall to my left, stairs in front, and something awful chasing me from behind. So I run up the steps all the way to the top, but when I start to turn right and run between the row of seats, I stop and turn around to look at what's chasing me. Instead of a monster, it's an androgynous-looking human being who isn't frightening at all. The face appears to be similar to mine, is beautiful, and I'm no longer afraid. Though I can't articulate the experience, I sensed some truth about myself and/or life.",293,"Dream Text: Worst Nightmare",2010-08-03T05:12:30+00:00,zogby_052110:17297,"2010 Demographic Survey",Female,"Not sure",50-64,45-64,95991,"Upper-middle income",$75-100K,"Hispanic or Latino","College Degree",Col+,Hisp,West,"College Degree+",2,Prog,2,Other/None,,D/W/S,Divorced/separated,63.00,Yes,No,Never,"Not Important",Yes,California,"903,917","Hisp Dem","Other Female","17,975",Total,Yes,No,0,"Very likely",Liberal,Yes,23,23,Woodstockers,,Obama,6,Yes,No,,"Not sure",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Obama,Democratic,"Several times a week",Obama,"Less than once a month",Democratic,"Two or three times a month",No,Yes,Yes

"I was in the church I actually attended at the time, looking down from above. The church was full, people were crying. The casket was open and the body inside was mine. As people started waking by the casket to pay their final respects, my view changed. Now I was laying the the casket and could see them looking down at me. In my mind, I was screaming at them that I was alive, but I couldn't move and no noise would come out. Even though I could see them, to them my eyes appeared shut. I saw the casket closing and felt myself being carried out of the church. Next I felt being lowered into the ground and hearing the sounds of dirt falling on the top of the casket.

"I had this nightmare when I was a child. I dreamt I was in the house of a neighbor who had, along with his daughter in real life, sexually molested me. I was in their living room with the Samoyed husky who belonged to my family. He was called Oso. His full name was Oso de Blanco Grande (big white bear). The room was entirely empty, the windows were open and curtains were blowing in a gentle summer breeze. I remember enjoying the look of the trees outside the window and the translucent yellow curtains. The sun was shining on a wooden floor so highly polished that Oso and I could see ourselves in it. It was as reflective as a mirror. Oso and I walked to the middle of the floor. I knelt down, sitting back on my heels, and Oso sat beside me. We stared at our reflections. It was a truly peaceful and loving moment between us. Slowly, however, as we watched, Oso's reflection began to change. It seemed to swirl and splinter gradually, interesting to watch at first. I looked at Oso and saw that the changes were only occurring in his reflection, not him. My reflection didn't change at all. The changes in his reflection became more pronounced, splintering, revolving, and becoming little by little more and more malevolent. I began to be upset and afraid and Oso started to claw and whine at his reflection. I began to beat his reflection with my hands, not hard at first. But as the changes appeared to change from malevolence to outright evil I began to hit Oso's reflection harder and harder and began to shout at it and eventually scream at it. Oso stood up and barked, snapped and clawed at his reflection even more forcefully. For a long time this had no effect. I was beginning to feel exhausted when I noticed that little by little the swirling was slowing and the splintering decreasing. Oso and I kept up our efforts until slowly, very slowly his reflection returned to normal. At last it did, and Oso sat down again. We stared at our reflections for a long while to make sure, I think, that everything was OK again. I remember feeling fearful for him. Then we looked into each others eyes. A peaceful feeling returned, even a victorious feeling, but also a feeling of complete exhaustion and grief.",403,"Dream Text: Worst Nightmare",2010-08-03T05:16:00+00:00,zogby_052110:47030,"2010 Demographic Survey",Female,Yes,50-64,45-64,87105,"Upper-middle income",$75-100K,White,"College Degree",Col+,White,West,"College Degree+",1,Prog,2,Protestant,No/NS,Married,Married,53.00,Yes,No,1-2/Mo,"Not Important",Yes,"New Mexico","978,267","White Dem","Married Female","78,635",Total,Yes,Yes,1,"Very likely",Liberal,Yes,22,22,Woodstockers,No,Obama,8,Yes,No,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,No,Yes,Obama,Democratic,"Several times a week",Obama,"Less than once a month",Democratic,"Two or three times a month",Yes,Yes,No/NS

At one house the door opens and a lady and her children invite me in û but the winding walkway, steep, brick lined, is very long and as I walk up to the house it seems to withdrawal, and I struggle to the door to find no one. I enter to hear the children laughing somewhere. I try to follow the laughter on to realize the children are crying. I turn to run but there is only one door now in the roomà..it seems like forever to make it to the door.

"There is a tie between my two worst nightmares. The first involves my grandmother and the other involves my cousin and grandpa. In the first one I am sitting in what is supposed to be my grandmother's house and she is in a rocking chair knitting. She is looking at me suddenly with an extremely strange look on her face. The entire world except me turns red. I am all white. She has an ax and follows me all the way down a red corridor. I had this dream several times. She never caught up to me but she was surly trying to hurt me, possibly kill me. The second dream is one that I also had for several years when I was younger. I would be getting picked up by my grandpa after gymnastics practice, much like real life. Grandpa would be in the process of driving my cousin and I home and all the sudden there was this black tunnel. Once we were inside the darkness of the tunnel grandpa would fall asleep at the wheel. I would always have to take the wheel and I can remember feeling so full of fear and worry but I always made it through it.",204,"Dream Text: Worst Nightmare",2010-08-03T05:12:51+00:00,zogby_052110:23975,"2010 Demographic Survey",Female,Yes,18-24,18-29,65560,,,White,"Some College",SomeCol,White,Midwest,"No College Degree",1,Prog,4,Other/None,,Single,"Single, never married",21.00,Yes,No,Rarely,"Very important",No/NS,Missouri,"1,079,683","White Ind","Other Female","27,433",Total,Yes,Yes,5,"Very likely",Liberal,Yes,24,24,"First Globals",Yes,Other,6,Yes,No,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,"Did not vote",Constitution,"Several times a week",Other,"Not sure",Independent,"Several times a week",Yes,Yes,No/NS
